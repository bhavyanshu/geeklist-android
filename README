The official Android App for geekli.st.

Needs the geeklist Java SDK to be build (https://github.com/stefanhoth/geeklist-sdk-java)

Use mvn clean install -DskipTests to install the SDK to your local repo.

The app itself utilizes ActionBarSherlock Version 4 (https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock) for compability with Android 2.2 and above.
